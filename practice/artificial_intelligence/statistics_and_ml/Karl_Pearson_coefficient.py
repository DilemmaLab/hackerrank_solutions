# Problem:
# Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history:

# Physics Scores  15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3
# History Scores  10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15

# Compute Karl Pearsonâ€™s coefficient of correlation between these scores.
# Compute the answer correct to three decimal places.

# Output Format

# In the text box, using the language of your choice, print the floating point/decimal value required. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

# For example, if your answer is 0.255. In python you can print using

# print("0.255")

# This is NOT the actual answer - just the format in which you should provide your answer.
